## About Ella Ubani

Emmanuella is a Dart & Javascript developer with over 4 years of Flutter and React experience.

Flutter and React Native are Emmanuella's primary area of expertise, and she has developed many projects using state management frameworks like Redux, including the one on the profile where she developed a telemedicine and pharmaceutical application that includes video calls and patient consultations. In addition, Emmanuella is passionate about mobile applications as she regularly expands her knowledge on this field.

Africa's first media streaming platform with over 1000+ downloads, the 2020/2021 YOMAFA Global Awards Winner, was her creation in her early days as a mobile app developer. Two years later, she was hired as a mobile app engineer for Metrock, a prestigious and well known bakery company. Through this trial, she gained first-hand experience in designing REST APIs using Laravel and PHP, while developing applications using React.

For the same company, Emmanuella was part of the review team that evaluated conceptual designs for inventory, materials, and HR staffing systems. To date, her job reviews and recommendations have spread around the globe. In recent weeks, she has been contracted by a company based in the US and a start-up in the UK.
